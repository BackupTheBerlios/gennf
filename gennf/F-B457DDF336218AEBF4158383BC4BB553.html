<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>gennf is a version management system for distributed repositories.</p>

<p>Distributed version management means that there is no need for a central
repository which avoids single points of failure and provides means to
structure the repositories according to some external criteria like
responsibilities or maintenanceships. We implement a system that does
not require for each site hosting a repository to
store all revisions of projects which can cause huge storage
consumption.</p>


<h2><a name="state">Current state of the project</a></h2>

<p>A prototype to handle the distribution is written. It
works with flat repositories only, the structure part is
currently under development.
All this can be read in our
<a href="gennf-report.pdf">report</a> (not yet finished) or, in
brief, in the <a href="folien.pdf">slides</a> of
the intermediate project presentation of January 31, 2006
(in German, though).</p>


<h2><a name="details">Project details</a></h2>

<p>Development of this project is part of the course
<a href="http://flp.cs.tu-berlin.de/lehre/wise05-06/ossi.html">
<em>Infrastructures for Open Source Software Development</em></a> held
at <a href="http://www.tu-berlin.de/">Berlin Technical University</a>.</p>

<p>gennf incorporates ideas from
<a href="http://users.footprints.net/~kaz/mcvs.html">Meta-CVS</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The directory structure of a project is separated from the
repository's structure. Each file in a project has a
unique identifier and is mapped to its directory by a separate
mapping database, which is also stored in the repository.
This makes versioning of moves and renames possible.</li>
<li>gennf uses <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">cvs</a>
as its backend, i.&nbsp;e. it is - like Meta-CVS -
a client-only wrapper around cvs. This has the advantage that only cvs is
needed on the repository servers which is available at nearly
every site.<li>
<li>gennf is also developed in Common&nbsp;Lisp.</li>
</ul>

<p>In detail, the we want to provide the following possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Distributing repositories over many sites has several advantages:
The failover behaviour is much better, the active spots in the code
are more local to their developers, every developer or group of
developers can have their own repository and do not clutter
the main trunk with unstable or experimental code.</p>

<p>gennf will provide a possibility to <em>inherit</em> from an
already existing repository which means to create a branch
at another site. It is not necessary for this new site to store the
whole history of the project: gennf will establish a link between the two.
Whenever someone at the new repository requests a version not locally
available, it will be fetched from the original site. It is of course
possible to replicate large parts of or the whole history to improve
performance or redundancy. However, replicated parts of the history still
know where they come from.</p>

<p>The different lines of development can be merged together, of course.
gennf keeps track of the origin of the code merged in. The mechanism
of merge is used to create branches, too. In fact, a merge is the only
basic operation gennf knows about, apart from ordinary commits (which
do not come from another site but out of some developer's head).
Both - commits and merges - are called changes.</p></li>

<li><p>It seems that gennf needs only very basic support from the backend:
basically the possibility to create a repository, to store code (to
which a revision number is assigned) and to retrieve code (by providing
a revision number). It is also planned to include a backend-abstraction
layer such that other servers than cvs could be used.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="repo">A word about our cvs repository</a></h3>

<p>We use Meta-CVS to manage our code. In consequence our
repository looks very strange. It contains only files with names
like <kbd>F-01BFC84C7B5AA5916B1FC95B481B0DEC.lisp</kbd>. This is due
to the unique ranaming scheme applied by Meta-CVS which will be part of
gennf of course. That means, if one wants to check out our code,
Meta-CVS should be used with the following commands:</p>

<pre>
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:/cvsroot/gennf login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:2401/cvsroot/gennf
CVS password:
$ CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:/cvsroot/gennf mcvs co gennf
[1]> cvs server: Updating MCVS
U MCVS/.cvsignore
U MCVS/F-01BFC84C7B5AA5916B1FC95B481B0DEC.lisp
<...>
</pre>

<p>The password is empty. Please note using <kbd>cvs</kbd> to login and <kbd>mcvs</kbd>
to check out. Meta-CVS relies on cvs for all repository-sandbox interaction.</p>


<h2><a name="mailinglist">Mailing list</a></h2>

<p>We have a developers mailing list <kbd>gennf-devel@lists.berlios.de</kbd> to
discuss gennf development. Commit messages are posted to this list.
Sometimes messages in German appear.</p>

<p>The list archive is at
<kbd><a href="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/gennf-devel/">
