<p>gennf is a version management system for distributed repositories
which supports code signing.</p>


<a name="state"><h2>Current state of the project</h2></a>

<p>The initial planning has not yet been concluded. The current state
can be seen in our <a href="scratchpad.pdf"><em>scratchpad</em></a>,
which is a document containing finished an unfinished concepts, plans
and the like.</p>

<a name="details"><h2>Project details</h2></a>

<p>Development of this project is part of the course
<a href="http://flp.cs.tu-berlin.de/lehre/wise05-06/ossi.html">
<em>Infrastructures for Open Source Software Development</em></a> held
at <a href="http://www.tu-berlin.de/">Berlin Technical University</a>.</p>

<p>gennf is based on <a href="http://users.footprints.net/~kaz/mcvs.html">
Meta-CVS</a> which in turn is a wrapper around
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">cvs</a>.
Meta-CVS is written in Common Lisp and so will be gennf. The Common
Lisp implementation currently used is <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">
CLISP</a>.</p>

<p>Extending Meta-CVS has the advantage that only cvs is
needed on the repository servers which is available at nearly
every site. gennf has to be installed on clients only. As gennf
is written in Common Lisp it will be available on many platforms.</p>

<p>In detail, the we want to provide the following possibilities:

<ul>
<li><a>A developer using gennf should be able to sign his patches via
an already known-to-work and widely deployed public key cryptosystem.</p>

<p>An auditor should be able to look at any number of parts of the code
and sign them digitally after a successful code audit.</p>

<p>A user checking out code should be able to verify the code, looking
at the different trust levels of the lines of code.
He should be able to easily spot the lines
which are least trusted according to his web of trust. If he cares much
about security, he can audit those hot spots and sign them in the repository,
becoming an auditor.</p>

<p>Hence, the trust is moved from the single point of failure (the repository
server) to every developer (able to protect his private key, or otherwise
revoke his key).</p></li>

<li><p>Distributing repositories over many sites has several advantages:
The failover behaviour is much better, the active spots in the code
are more local to their developers, every developer or group of
developers can have their own repository and do not clutter
the main trunk with unstable or experimental code.</p>

<p>gennf will provide a possibility to <em>inherit</em> from an
already existing repository which means to create a branch
at another site. It is not necessary for this new site to store the
whole history of the project: gennf will establish a link between the two.
Whenever someone at the new repository requests a version not locally
available, it will be fetched from the original site. It is of course
possible to replicate large parts of or the whole history to improve
performance or redundancy. However, duplicated parts of the history still
know where they come from.</p>

<p>The different lines of development can be merged together, of course.
gennf keeps track of the origin of the code merged in. The mechanism
of merge is used to create branches, too. In fact, a merge is the only
basic operation gennf knows about, apart from ordinary changes (which
do not come from another site but out of some developer's head).
Both - changes and merges - are called commits.</p></li>

<li><p>It seems that gennf needs only very basic support from the backend:
basically the possibility to create a repository, to store code (to
which a revision number is assigned) and to retrieve code (by providing
a revision number). It is also planned to include a backend-abstraction
layer such that other servers than cvs could be used.</p></li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>A word about our cvs repository</h3>

<p>We use Meta-CVS to manage our code. In consequence our
repository looks very strange. It contains only files with names
like <kbd>F-01BFC84C7B5AA5916B1FC95B481B0DEC.lisp</kbd>. This is due
to the unique ranaming scheme applied by Meta-CVS which will be part of
gennf of course. That means, if one wants to check out our code,
Meta-CVS should be used with the following commands:</p>

<pre>
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:/cvsroot/gennf login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:2401/cvsroot/gennf
CVS password:
$ CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:/cvsroot/gennf mcvs co gennf
[1]> cvs server: Updating MCVS
U MCVS/.cvsignore
U MCVS/F-01BFC84C7B5AA5916B1FC95B481B0DEC.lisp
<...>
</pre>

<p>The password is empty. Please note using <kbd>cvs</kbd> to login and <kbd>mcvs</kbd>
to check out. Meta-CVS relies on cvs for all repository-sandbox interaction.</p>
