<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>gennf is a version management system for distributed repositories
which supports code signing.</p>

<p>Code signing intends to open the possibility that the origin of each
chunk of code of a piece of software can be verified using
public/private key signing. Without code signing users and other
developers have to trust the integrity of the machine hosting the
sources.
<br>
Distributed version management means that there is no need for a central
repository which avoids single points of failure and provides means to
structure the repositories according to some external criteria like
responsibilities or maintenanceships. We implement a system that does
not require for each site hosting a repository to
store all revisions of projects which can cause huge storage
consumption.</p>


<h2><a name="state">Current state of the project</a></h2>

<p>The handling of distributed repositories is specified. It is
still some way to an implementation but the necessary ideas are there.
The next step is to put them into code.
The requirements for code signing support are laid out but
the integration into the distributed part is not yet specified.
All this can be read in our
<a href="scratchpad.pdf"><em>scratchpad</em></a>.</p>

<p>The development of a prototype to handle branch, merge,
commit, checkout, update and import operations in the distribution
model laid out in the <em>scratchpad</em> has begun.
<br>
The prototype will only handle flat repositories. Operations
for directory structure as provided by Meta-CVS will be integrated
in a second step.</p>


<h2><a name="details">Project details</a></h2>

<p>Development of this project is part of the course
<a href="http://flp.cs.tu-berlin.de/lehre/wise05-06/ossi.html">
<em>Infrastructures for Open Source Software Development</em></a> held
at <a href="http://www.tu-berlin.de/">Berlin Technical University</a>.</p>

<p>gennf incorporates ideas from
<a href="http://users.footprints.net/~kaz/mcvs.html">Meta-CVS</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The directory structure of a project is separated from the
repository's structure. Each file in a project has a
unique identifier and is mapped to its directory by a separate
mapping database, which is also stored in the repository.
This makes versioning of moves and renames possible.</li>
<li>gennf uses <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">cvs</a>
as its backend, i.&nbsp;e. it is - like Meta-CVS -
a client-only wrapper around cvs. This has the advantage that only cvs is
needed on the repository servers which is available at nearly
every site.<li>
<li>gennf is also developed in Common&nbsp;Lisp.</li>
</ul>

<p>In detail, the we want to provide the following possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A developer using gennf should be able to sign his patches via
an already known-to-work and widely deployed public key cryptosystem.</p>

<p>An auditor should be able to look at any number of parts of the code
and sign them digitally after a successful code audit.</p>

<p>A user checking out code should be able to verify the code, looking
at the different trust levels of the lines of code.
He should be able to easily spot the lines
which are least trusted according to his web of trust. If he cares much
about security, he can audit those hot spots and sign them in the repository,
becoming an auditor.</p>

<p>Hence, the trust is moved from the single point of failure (the repository
server) to every developer (able to protect his private key, or otherwise
revoke his key).</p></li>

<li><p>Distributing repositories over many sites has several advantages:
The failover behaviour is much better, the active spots in the code
are more local to their developers, every developer or group of
developers can have their own repository and do not clutter
the main trunk with unstable or experimental code.</p>

<p>gennf will provide a possibility to <em>inherit</em> from an
already existing repository which means to create a branch
at another site. It is not necessary for this new site to store the
whole history of the project: gennf will establish a link between the two.
Whenever someone at the new repository requests a version not locally
available, it will be fetched from the original site. It is of course
possible to replicate large parts of or the whole history to improve
performance or redundancy. However, replicated parts of the history still
know where they come from.</p>

<p>The different lines of development can be merged together, of course.
gennf keeps track of the origin of the code merged in. The mechanism
of merge is used to create branches, too. In fact, a merge is the only
basic operation gennf knows about, apart from ordinary commits (which
do not come from another site but out of some developer's head).
Both - commits and merges - are called changes.</p></li>

<li><p>It seems that gennf needs only very basic support from the backend:
basically the possibility to create a repository, to store code (to
which a revision number is assigned) and to retrieve code (by providing
a revision number). It is also planned to include a backend-abstraction
layer such that other servers than cvs could be used.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="repo">A word about our cvs repository</a></h3>

<p>We use Meta-CVS to manage our code. In consequence our
repository looks very strange. It contains only files with names
like <kbd>F-01BFC84C7B5AA5916B1FC95B481B0DEC.lisp</kbd>. This is due
to the unique ranaming scheme applied by Meta-CVS which will be part of
gennf of course. That means, if one wants to check out our code,
Meta-CVS should be used with the following commands:</p>

<pre>
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:/cvsroot/gennf login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:2401/cvsroot/gennf
CVS password:
$ CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gennf.berlios.de:/cvsroot/gennf mcvs co gennf
[1]> cvs server: Updating MCVS
U MCVS/.cvsignore
U MCVS/F-01BFC84C7B5AA5916B1FC95B481B0DEC.lisp
<...>
</pre>

<p>The password is empty. Please note using <kbd>cvs</kbd> to login and <kbd>mcvs</kbd>
to check out. Meta-CVS relies on cvs for all repository-sandbox interaction.</p>


<h2><a name="mailinglist">Mailing list</a></h2>

<p>We have a developers mailing list <kbd>gennf-devel@lists.berlios.de</kbd> to
discuss gennf development. Commit messages are posted to this list.
Sometimes messages in german appear.</p>

<p>The list archive is at
<kbd><a href="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/gennf-devel/">
