TODO
====

* A log message browser should be offered.
  A repository browser in general would be nice.
* For the merging: An equality predicate which disregards differences
  in whitespace might be helpful.
* commit should offer a restart to do an update if conflicts
  occur. If the update is conflict-free, it should be offered the
  possibility to proceed with the commit or the quit.
  If the update has conflicts too, it should be quit.
* The lock-problem (cf. e-mail from Florian) is not considered in
  commit. It is assumed that the complete commit procedure
  is not interrupted by some other commit.
  The retry macro is somehow for this purpose but it is not
  consequently used yet.
* The retry macro should signal a condition if the maximum
  number of retries is exceeded.
* When merging, proper mark up functions, which inserts filenames
  and stuff, should be used.


ABANDONED
=========

* The whole replication is thrown away.
