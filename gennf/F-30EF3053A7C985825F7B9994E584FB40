TODO

High priority
-------------
* List of all changes of a branch. This includes following links.

Low priority/Deferred
---------------------
* 3 way merge for branching (if this is not implemented, the accoding
  section in the report should be updated, because 3 way merge is in
  fact quite easy possible).
* Diff between two changes (with restriction to certain files).
* A log message browser should be offered.
* For the merging: An equality predicate which disregards differences
  in whitespace might be helpful.
* Error handling:
  * commit should offer a restart to do an update if conflicts
    occur. If the update is conflict-free, it should be offered the
    possibility to proceed with the commit or the quit.
    If the update has conflicts too, it should be quit.
  * The lock-problem (cf. e-mail from Florian) is not considered in
    commit. It is assumed that the complete commit procedure
    is not interrupted by some other commit.
    The retry macro is somehow for this purpose but it is not
    consequently used yet.
  * The retry macro should signal a condition if the maximum
    number of retries is exceeded.
* These items should be included in the report in the 'Dropped
  Features' section.


ABANDONED
=========

* The whole replication is thrown away.
