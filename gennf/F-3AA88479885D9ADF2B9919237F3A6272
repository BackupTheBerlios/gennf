				Installing Meta-CVS

1. Verify system requirements.

   Meta-CVS requires CLISP 2.27 or greater. It requires a POSIX system,
   and a /dev/urandom device for obtaining random data. Here are some
   platforms that Meta-CVS has been successfully run on by its author:

     GNU/Linux (IA-32 Red Hat 6.2 and 7.2)
     Windows (Cygwin 1.3.13-1 and 1.5.x)

   using these CLISP versions:

     CLISP 2.27, 2.28, 2.29, 2.30 and 2.32
 
   It has been reported to run on FreeBSD, Solaris, Debian and Gentoo Linux.

   You are encouraged to be conservative regarding what version of GCC is
   used for compiling CLISP.  Meta-CVS was found *not* to run on one user's
   AMD Athlon machine running GNU/Linux, with CLISP 2.30 compiled using GCC
   3.2. On the same system, it worked when rebuilt with the same version of
   CLISP that was rebuilt from scratch using GCC 2.95.3.

2. Obtain CLISP and build it. CLISP can be downloaded from
   http://clisp.sourceforge.net. Here is how to build CLISP,
   in one step:

   ./configure --build build-dir

   The name of the build directory can be anything you want; the
   choice ``build-dir'' is arbitrary. The directory is created and
   CLISP is built there. When the build is done, complete the installation:

   cd build-dir
   make install

   When CLISP is installed, you should be just able to run it using the
   ``clisp'' command, assuming that the installation directory /usr/local/bin
   is in your PATH. 

3. Unpack the Meta-CVS distribution, cd to the code subdirectory 
   and run the ./install.sh script.  It takes one argument, which
   must be an absolute path name of the prefix where you want Meta-CVS
   to reside. For example ./install.sh /usr/local will create
   the file /usr/local/bin/mcvs, and some files under the
   /usr/local/lib/clisp/meta-cvs/ directory:

   cd code
   ./install.sh /usr/local    # /usr/local requires superuser privileges

4. Assuming that this installation places in somewhere in your PATH,
   you should now be able to type ``mcvs'' and get the error
   message ``Meta-CVS requires a command argument.''.
