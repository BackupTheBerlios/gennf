		 INSTALL NOTES FOR GENNF %%VERSION%%
***************************************************************************


Build and install requirements
------------------------------

The following tools and packages are necessary to build and install
gennf:

* Steel Bank Commmon Lisp 0.9.10 (http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/)
* pdfLaTeX (http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/)
* GNU make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* Osicat (http://common-lisp.net/project/osicat/)
* CL-DIFFLIB (http://www.cliki.net/CL-DIFFLIB)
* UFFI (http://uffi.b9.com/)
* port-path (http://prdownload.berlios.de/gennf/port-path-0.1.tar.gz)

It may well be possible to built with another toolchain but this
certainly requires some hacking of the makefiles. GNU make is the only
make guarenteed to accept the makefiles.
pdfLaTeX is only required if you want to TeX the gennf report, which
is done by default.

Osicat, CL-DIFFLIB and UFFI are ASDF-Installable. ASDF-Install comes bundled
with SBCL. To install e. g. CL-DIFFLIB type at the REPL:

CL-USER> (asdf-install:install "cl-difflib")

The package will be fetched and installed (do not forget to load
ASDF-Install before issueing the form).

port-path is a pathname library written by the gennf developers and it
is still under development. It is not yet quite ASDF-Installable but
you can download a tarball from the then website noted above and let
ASDF-Install pick that file:

CL-USER> (asdf-install:install "/path/to/the/port-path/tarball")


Building and installing gennf
-----------------------------

To build gennf, expand the tarball

$ gzip -d gennf-x.y.tar.gz | tar xf -

and change to the gennf-x.y directory. Type

$ gmake

to compile the system and build the documentation.

Type

$ gmake install

to install gennf. Normally, gennf installs its files under
/usr/local. If you want to change that, append

PREFIX=/another/path

to BOTH calls to gmake.

gennf can now be called with $PREFIX/bin/gennf.

In case you want to change the locations of the install process, most
of the settings are in the file GNUmakefile.include.

If you want to generate the HTML documentation of the Common Lisp
code, change to the doc subdirectory in the source tree and type

$ gmake gennf-doc

A subdirectory gennf-doc is created with the code
documentation. However, CLDOC is required to generate the HTML
files. It can be obtained from http://common-lisp.net/project/cldoc/.
