As part of the course "Infrastructures for Open Source Software
Development" [1] held by Steffen Evers at Berlin Technical University
[2], we want to implement a distributed version management system with
code signing support.

Code signing intends to open the possibility that the origin of each
chunk of code of a piece of software can be verified using
public/private key signing. Without code signing users and other
developers have to trust the integrity of the machine hosting the
sources.

Distributed version management means that there is no need for a central
repository which avoids single points of failure and provides means to
structure the repositories according to some external criteria like
responsibilities or maintenanceships. We want to implement a system
without the necessity that each site hosting a repository has to
store all revisions of projects which can cause huge storage
consumption.

We want to implement the system as an extension of Meta-CVS [3], which
is open source under the GPL license. The code signing will 
heavily rely on GnuPG [4].
Meta-CVS is written in CLISP [5], which is an open source implementation
of Common Lisp [6]. To ease development, our code will be written in
Common Lisp (using CLISP extension when necessary).

The name of the project will be gennf.
